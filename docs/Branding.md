This document defines how partner branding is implemented across the licensing platform. Branding allows every distributor and reseller to maintain their identity while operating within the unified P4 Software environment.

## Branding Options per Partner

Each partner has the ability to customize:

- **Logo (SVG or PNG)**  
  Used on login screen, dashboard header, and all email templates

- **Accent Color and Primary Color**  
  Used for theming MudBlazor components dynamically

- **Theme Mode**  
  Light or dark, selected by the partner and saved per session or user

- **Email Footer (HTML)**  
  Customizable per language (e.g., English, Spanish)

- **Favicon (PNG)**  
  Displayed in browser tab and PWA manifest

## Where Branding is Applied

| Area                        | Description                             |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Login Page                 | Partner logo, background color, and theme mode used |
| Admin Dashboard            | Logo in header, accent colors in side nav, charts, cards |
| Email Notifications        | Logo, footer, button styles match partner theme |
| Report Templates           | Reports rendered with selected branding settings |
| Mobile App (Future)        | Color theme and partner icon preloaded for Flutter |

## Branding Storage

Branding preferences are stored in the `PartnerBranding` entity:

```csharp
public class PartnerBranding {
  public Guid PartnerId { get; set; }
  public string LogoUrl { get; set; }
  public string PrimaryColor { get; set; }
  public string AccentColor { get; set; }
  public string EmailFooterHtml_EN { get; set; }
  public string EmailFooterHtml_ES { get; set; }
  public string FaviconUrl { get; set; }
  public string DefaultTheme { get; set; } // "light" or "dark"
}
```

## Branding UI Editor

Partners use the `/BrandingEditor.razor` page to:
- Upload logo and favicon
- Preview theme in real-time
- Save primary and accent color via color pickers
- Set HTML footers per language
- Test email templates with new branding

---

## Design Rules

- Logos are shown at a max height of 60px
- Color values must pass contrast validation (accessibility)
- Only verified partners may publish branding

---

## Developer Integration Notes

- Theming is injected via `MudTheme` with partner-specific override
- Email HTML is merged using Razor or string templates
- Live previews are supported with temporary override states
